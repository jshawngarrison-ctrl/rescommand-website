## ABOUT PAGE

**Goal:** Build trust, show origin story, explain philosophy

### Structure

**Hero Section:**
```
Headline:        "Built by Operators, for Operators"
Subheadline:     "ResCommand came from real restaurant chaos."
```

**The Origin Story (split layout):**

**Left Text:**
```
Copy:
"ResCommand wasn't born from a boardroom. It came from Duffers Donuts—a scratch-made donut shop in Charleston, South Carolina.

Catherine Williamson, our head baker, was juggling recipes in notebooks. The team was scattered across text messages. Prep schedules were printed yesterday, now outdated. We watched the chaos and decided: there has to be a better way.

We built ResCommand as the operating system our restaurant needed. Every feature answered a real question: 'How do we stop the bleeding here?' Not features we thought restaurants should want. Features restaurants are already trying to use in ten different tools."

Key Stats (callout boxes, Sky Blue background):
- 1 donut shop
- 4+ operations challenges solved
- 0 enterprise bloat
- ∞ sanity preserved
```

**Right Image:**
```
Photo:  Duffers Donuts kitchen, team photo, or operation shot
```

**Philosophy Section (full width):**

**Headline:** "Why We Do This"

**3-column narrative:**

Column 1: "Simple Doesn't Mean Stupid"
```
Copy:           "Small restaurants have the same compliance and operational rigor as big chains. We just don't have the staff to run five different tools. Everything in ResCommand is built for focus: do one thing, do it right."
```

Column 2: "Priced for Reality"
```
Copy:           "Enterprise software costs enterprise money. We price for a team of 5–50, not 500. You should never need a payment plan to manage your restaurant better."
```

Column 3: "Built to Last"
```
Copy:           "We don't chase hype features. We improve what matters: reliability, speed, and supporting the way you actually work."
```

**Team (optional, for future):**
```
Section heading: "The Team"
Copy:            "Placeholder: Team members and their roles. (To be filled when ready.)"
```

**CTA Bottom:**
```
Headline:        "Ready to Stop the Chaos?"
Button:          "Book a Demo" (Sky Blue)

## COPYWRITING GUIDELINES

### Tone & Voice
- **Audience:** Owner-operators (busy, pragmatic, skeptical of vendor hype)
- **Tone:** Honest, practical, clear. No fluff, no overselling.
- **Key Words:** "Built for you," "Real operations," "No bloat," "Your team," "Easier," "Clearer," "Your job just got simpler."
- **Avoid:** Corporate jargon ("synergy," "leverage," "optimize"), generic software language, condescension

### Headline Principles
- Lead with benefit, not feature
- Use active voice
- Short, punchy (no more than 12 words for H1, 15 for H2)
- Speak to a specific pain point or desired state

### CTA Copy
- Primary: "Book a Demo" (consistent across site)
- Secondary: "Start Free Trial," "Explore Features," "Learn More"
- Never: "Submit," "Click here," "Enter"

### Feature Descriptions
Structure:
```
